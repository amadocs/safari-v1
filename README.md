Botswana is a landlord country in Southern Africa. It is bordered by South Africa to the south and east, Namibia to the west, and Zimbabwe to the east. The country is roughly the size of France, yet over 40% of it is protected and conserved for wildlife. This is why the Botswana safaris holidays are unique, so you should absolutely try Botswana Safaris.

*WHAT IS A SAFARI*: 
In the broadest sense, to go on safari is simply to travel. More especially, A SAFARI is an exciting and adventurous way of seeing the ‘real Africa’ because it enables you to view a variety of wildlife in their natural habitat. As a result, going on a safari gives you an authentic experience of Africa. The purpose of a safari tour is to allow you to get intimate with the landscape and scenery. Safaris can involve walking through the wilderness, game viewing by 4x4 safari vehicle, boat, canoe, or small plane, to name a few.
